    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a system to generate recommendations \"offline\". This means that at some interval (like a cron job) the system writes recommendations to a database (Redis) for later retrieval. The architecture diagram below shows how it comes together from a bird's eye view.\n",

    "## 1.0 - Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "A multi-stage pipeline for a recommender system is a common approach to efficiently retrieve relevant items from a large catalog. The pipeline includes several stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A fast **Candidate Retrieval Model** quickly truncates the large item catalog to a relevant set of hundreds (or thousands) of items.\n",
    "2) Filtering is performed to remove undesirable or already-seen items.\n",
    "3) A finely-tuned deep learning **Ranking Model** (i.e. more powerful) ranks the most likely items that are going to interacted with.\n",
    "4) Results are ordered and returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing the recommendations to a key-value store like Redis allows developers to access the recommendations in near real-time at a later point without the complexity of hosting a live multi-stage recommendation system. This can be especially useful for developers who can't afford the complexity of hosting a live multi-stage recsys or need to get something up and running quickly. Additionally, by saving the recommendations in a key-value store rather than serving the models directly, this system can also save on the cost of hosting the model. The next notebook in this series will dive into when \"online\" recommendation systems are valuable using the same models created below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Prepare the [**Dataset**](#2.0---Dataset-Preparation)\n",
    "2) Build a [**Candidate Retrieval Model**](#3.0---Candidate-Retrieval-Model)\n",
    "3) Build a [**Ranking Model**](#4.0---Ranking-Model)\n",
    "4) [**Write Recommendations**](#5.0---Write-Recommendations-to-Redis) to Redis (offline)\n",
    "5) [**Fetch Recommendations**](#6.0---Fetch-Recommendations-from-Redis) from Redis\n",
    "6) [**Export Models**](#7.0---Export-Models) for later use"

One tower, called the \"user tower,\" is used to model the user's preferences, while the other tower, called the \"item tower,\" is used to model the characteristics of the items being recommended.\n",

    "The two towers are typically trained separately, but their outputs are combined to generate recommendations. The user tower produces a user representation vector, while the item tower produces an item representation vector.

    "\n",
    "Ranking models are a type of machine learning models that are commonly used in recommendation systems to rank items based on their relevance or likelihood of being interacted with by a user. These models can be used to generate personalized recommendations for individual users by taking into account their preferences and past interactions such as clicks, purchases, or ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of ranking models that can be used in recommendation systems, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collaborative Filtering models, which use the past interactions of users to generate recommendations\n",
    "2. Content-Based models, which generate recommendations based on the characteristics of the items\n",
    "3. Hybrid models, which combine the above two approaches (we will use this one)\n",

    "We will use a Deep Learning Recommendation Model [(DLRM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00091) architecture (published by Facebook/Meta in 2019) to score and rank User/Item pairs. The model was introduced as a personalization deep learning model that uses embeddings to process sparse features that represent categorical data and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to process dense features, then interacts these features explicitly using the statistical techniques proposed in [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694074). To learn more about DLRM architetcture please visit [this notebook](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/models/blob/main/examples/04-Exporting-ranking-models.ipynb) in the Merlin Models GH repo.\n"
